# R-Airport FlightsProject
To help understand what causes delays at NYC airports, I analyzed the nycflights13 dataset that contains information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) over a span of one year.  I identified and removed outliers in the data and ran linear and multiple regression models in R-Studio to help identify relationships between various variables and the departure delay.
